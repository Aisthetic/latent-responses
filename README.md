# Latent Responses

This code accompanies our paper "[Exploring the Latent Space of Autoencoders with Interventional Assays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.16091)".


## Installation and Setup

Assuming you have `python` (>=3.6) (and `pip`) installed. You can install the remaining dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 

Then, you can view the examples by starting the a jupyter notebook with `jupyter notebook`, and navigating to the notebooks `3dshapes-example.ipynb` and `toy-example.ipynb` in `notebooks/`.

All the project specific code is in the `src` directory.

## Usage/Documentation

[coming soon (but for now see the doc strings in the code)]
